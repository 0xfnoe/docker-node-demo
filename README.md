# NodeJS app

This repository contains docker application for tests!

# Functionality

### Run simple web application:  
```sh
docker-compose up --build web
```

For the educational reasons, the default port inside image is `8080`

Try to connect to web server:  
```console
$ curl localhost
hello from containerized application!
```

### Run tests for web app:  
Edit docker-compose.yml file. Change command to test:   
```yml
command: test
```

Then run the container:  
```console
$ docker-compose up --build web
Starting docker-demo_web_1 ... done
Attaching to docker-demo_web_1

### Run with an external file:  
Basically - I made this is to test Kubernetes ConfigMap. But you can run it with the file as volume or docker configs(swarm).  
To run with volumes: edit docker-compose.yml file. Change command to `run start-configmap`:   
```yml
command: run start-configmap
```

And add file as volume:  
```yml
volumes:
  - /path/to/your.json:/etc/configs/rawdata.json
```

Then run docker-compose and check url:  
```console
$ curl localhost/configmap
{"hello":"world"}
```

### Run this app with db:  
```sh
docker-compose -f db-compose.yml up --build
```
